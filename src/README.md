Readme for Groove Scribe Plus

### What is this repository for?

**Groove Scribe Plus** is a Fork of [**Groove Scribe**](https://github.com/montulli/GrooveScribe) designed for power users who would like to use the software offline.

For some context, as a drum educator, I've come to love using Groove Scribe for developing custom exercises and grooves to print out/send to students. With the spare time I have available, I intend to convert this codebase into an [Electron.JS](https://www.electronjs.org) project and add a variety of features befitting power users and educators.

For a more comprehensive list of planned work, see [Issues](https://github.com/jamie-on-drums/GrooveScribe-Plus/issues)

### How do I use it

\*Currently only available via building from source. Although in the future it would be nice to export to various app stores (potentially even mobile, using cordova).
